Fireflies - NCT Dream
Tell me 'bout your dreaming
I believe I was there, too
I could sense your breathing
Lying in a different room
'Cause laws of the universe
Always there to observe
You shimmer
Your inner compass is taking you there (You there)
I'll be your beacon
Illuminate while you on your way
Girl I've been there, too (Been there, too)
Don't be afraid tonight, afraid tonight (Oh yeah)
Just know you're never be lonely
I know it's hard sometimes, to see the light (See the light)
But you and I keep on dreaming (Come on!)
We gon' light it up
Light it up now, darling
We can make the stars align
We gon' light it up
Light it up, now we sparkling
Brighter than the fireflies (Fireflies)
Think it then believe it
And truth'll find its way
I know that you'll see it (Yeah, you'll see it)
If you come with me (Alright, alright hey!)
Show you what it's all about
Now we're gonna go all out
Don't gotta sing the blues (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you ever need me, shout
I'll always be around
Girl I've been there, too
Don't be afraid tonight, afraid tonight
Just know you'll never be lonely (Never be lonely)
I know it's hard sometimes, to see the light
But you and I keep on dreaming
We gon' light it up
Light it up now, darling
We can make the stars align
We gon' light it up
Light it up, now we sparkling
Brighter than the fireflies
We gonna light it up
(Oh, oh, oh) Look how we shining now
(Oh, oh, oh) You know it's only love
Brighter than the fireflies
Light it up, light it up
Like it's the first day of our lives
Fireflies, fireflies (Fireflies)
They see us dancing in the sky
We gon', we gon'
We gon' light it up
Light it up now, darling
We can make the stars align
We gon' light it up
Light it up now we sparkling
Brighter than the fireflies
(Keep shining)
We gonna light it up
(Oh, oh, oh) Look how we shining now
(Oh, oh, oh) You know it's only love
Brighter than the fireflies
